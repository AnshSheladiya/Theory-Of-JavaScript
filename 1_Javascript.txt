The length of the code reduces 

-------------------Disadvantages of External JavaScript---------------------
The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.
The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code.
A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files.
We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file.
If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code.
