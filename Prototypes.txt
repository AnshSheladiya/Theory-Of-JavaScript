All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype
Whenever we create anything (like an object or function) in JavaScript, 
the JS Engine automatically attaches that thing with some properties and methods.
All this comes via prototypes.
whenever a function is created the prototype property is added to that function automatically


Ex.
Date objects inherit properties from the Date prototype
Math objects inherit properties from the Math prototype
Array objects inherit properties from the Array prototype.
On top of the chain is Object.prototype. 
Every prototype inherits properties and methods from the Object.prototype.

Exmple:
let arr = ['Rajat', 'Raj']
console.log(arr.__proto__.forEach) //[Function: forEach]
console.log(arr.__proto__) // same as Array.prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__) // same as Object.prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__) // null
